Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning (OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors, termed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities. OCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying competitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the query. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing redundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This often results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally, mainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into the input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal information. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with re-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\emph{i)}$ We reduce redundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to update the remaining slots; $\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the first aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to enable self-distillation. Experiments demonstrate that DIAS achieves state-of-the-art on OCL tasks like object discovery and recognition, while also improving advanced visual prediction and reasoning.

## üåü Highlights

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ***Inherited from GitHub repo [VQ-VFM-OCL](https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL).*** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

- ‚úÖ **fp16 fast training** [Automatic mixed precision](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/amp_recipe.html) training (fp32+fp16) is enabled. Most of the training can be finished less than 4 or 8 hours (for image or video OCL respectively) using one V100 GPU.
- ‚úÖ **less I/O overhead** Datasets are stored in [LMBD](https://lmdb.readthedocs.io) database format to save I/O overhead, beneficial especially on computing cluster.

- ‚úÖ **config-driven experiment** This is totally config-driven framework, largely inspired by [OpenMMLab](https://github.com/open-mmlab), but with much less capsulation.

- ‚úÖ **strong baselines** <!-- All models requiring VAE are implemented with StableDiffusion pretrained VAE [TinyVAE](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.30.1/en/api/models/autoencoder_tiny); --> All models are trained with [strong](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07764) data augmentations; All models employ vision foundation model [DINO2](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/dinov2) as their backbone.



## üöëÔ∏è Changelogs

- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê [2025/10/21] ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Object discovery accuracy values are updated for version 3. Check this table file [acc-v3.xlsx](acc-v3.xlsx) for details**.
- [2025/10/20] Version 3 (based on [VQ-VFM-OCL](https://github.com/Genera1Z/VQ-VFM-OCL)): re-implement segmentation evaluation; corresponding new dataset lmdb files are uploaded. Thus, object discovery acc could change a little, especially ARI values.

## üî• How to Use


### (1) Install

(Using Python version 3.11)
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Use package versions no older than the specification.


### (2) Prepare

Download **converted datasets** or convert original datasets into LMDB format: 
```shell
python convert.py
```
But **firstly** download original datasets according to docs of ```XxxDataset.convert_dataset()```.


### (3) Train

Run training:
```shell
python train.py
```
But **firstly** change the arguments marked with ```TODO XXX``` to your needs.

For example,
```shell
python train.py \
    --seed 42 \
    --cfg_file config-dias/dias_r-coco.py \
    --data_dir path/to/coco
```


### (4) Evaluate

Run evaluation:
```shell
python eval.py
```
But **firstly** modify places marked with ``TODO XXX`` according to your needs.



## üí° Tips

1. Any config file can be converted into typical Python code by changing from
```Python
model = dict(type=ClassName, key1=value1,..)
```
to
```Python
model = ClassName(key1=value1,..)
```

2. All config files follow a similar structure, and you can use file comparator [Meld](https://meldmerge.org) with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) plugin [Meld Diff](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danielroedl.meld-diff) to check their differences.
